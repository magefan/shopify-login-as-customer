## Features
### Provide Top-Notch Customer Support
In the ever-growing world of eCommerce, it becomes more difficult to stand out from similar stores and capture the attention of potential customers. The intuitive design and vast catalog are hardly enough, so you have to look for more feasible options.

What makes your store better than others is the relationship you have with your customers. Prompt communication and effective assistance make you a trusted partner and highlight your brandâ€™s reliability.

The Shopify Login as Customer app is designed for this exact purpose.

### Log in to Customer Accounts in a Few Clicks
If you have the Shopify Login as Customer App, you donâ€™t have to go through the hassle of requesting customer login credentials. Instead, you can help customers to place orders and fix account-related issues in minutes. 

This tool supports Multipass and enables you to log in to customer accounts in Shopify in the backend in one click. No technical hassle or complicated steps required. Just click on the customer and log in to their account.

Better customer support is just one click away!

</p>

### Give Customers a Chance to Request Assistance
Even if you are not using Multipass, there is still a way for you to log in to customer accounts. The Shopify Login as Customer App allows customers to request assistance right from their accounts, making the process convenient for both store managers and customers. 

Additionally, store managers can request access to customer accounts from their end as well.  So, once access is granted, they can provide efficient assistance and make your support more time-effective and client-oriented.

</p>

### Reset Customer Password to Log in
If the situation calls for immediate action and you cannot wait till customers request assistance, the Shopify Login as Customer app has an alternative option for you. 

You may easily reset the account's password to get in and provide support quickly. Then, your customers will just need to set a new password once your part is completed.

It just couldnâ€™t be easier!

</p>

### Provide Excellent Support For New Customer Accounts
Shopify is exploring better login options and has introduced new customer accounts. Similarly to B2B accounts, they do not require passwords: just enter a one-time code, and thatâ€™s it. And itâ€™s not a problem for this Login as Customer app either.

It allows you to receive the 6-digit code in the admin panel and proceed with logging in to new customer accounts without any additional services. Once logged in, you can assist your customers and provide them with the support they need.

</p>

### Track the Login Activity
While being able to log in to customer accounts is a huge perk, it requires some supervision. If you have many support agents working in admin and helping different clients, it would be useful to keep track of the login activity.

The Shopify Login as Customer app generates a separate grid featuring all recent logins. Not only does the app improve your support effort, but it also helps you preserve a safe environment and keep track of the logins.

</p>

### Place Orders for Your Customers
This Shopify Login as Customer app goes even further and allows you to place orders on behalf of your customers. Just log in to the customerâ€™s account and complete the purchase on the storefront without any hassle.

Whatâ€™s more, you can track whether the order was placed by the customer or the support agent right in the admin panel. This helps to better analyse the sales and manage them accordingly.

### Integrate External CRMs or Helpdesks
Depending on your customer management approach, you may implement external helpdesks or CRM systems to stay in touch with your customers. Can the login as customer functionality cover them as well?

The answer is yes! The Shopify Login as Customer app offers API endpoints to integrate with third-party applications. Thus, you are not limited to Shopify only, but can provide excellent customer support across various channels.
